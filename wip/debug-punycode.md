Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: In Node.js, there's a deprecation warning about the punycode module saying to use a userland alternative instead. Our dependencies are: @browserbasehq/stagehand ^1.12.0, dotenv ^16.4.7, eventsource-client ^1.1.3, repomix ^0.2.24, zod ^3.24.1, and playwright ^1.50.1 as a peer dependency. Which of these might be causing the punycode deprecation warning and how can we fix it?
The punycode deprecation warning is likely coming from a nested dependency rather than a direct dependency. Based on the information provided, here are the potential sources and solutions:

1. @browserbasehq/stagehand: This package or its dependencies may be using punycode. Check if updating to the latest version resolves the issue.

2. eventsource-client: This package depends on whatwg-url, which uses punycode[1]. Update eventsource-client to the latest version, as newer versions may have addressed this.

3. repomix: This package or its dependencies may be using punycode. Try updating to the latest version.

To resolve the issue:

1. Update all dependencies to their latest versions:

```
npm update
```

2. If the warning persists, identify the exact source:

```
npm ls punycode
```

3. If a specific package is identified, try overriding the punycode version in your package.json:

```json
"overrides": {
  "punycode": "^2.3.0"
}
```

4. As a temporary workaround, suppress the warning by adding NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 to your start script[4]:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 node your-script.js"
}
```

5. If the issue persists, consider replacing the problematic dependency with an alternative that doesn't use punycode.
