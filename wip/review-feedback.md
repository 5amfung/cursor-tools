Okay, let's review the Stagehand integration files in `wip/` and assess their consistency, identify mistakes/omissions, suggest improvements, and evaluate integration with the existing browser command.

**Review of `wip/stagehand-docs.md`:**

This file provides documentation for Stagehand. It looks like a standard documentation file, covering:

- Overview of Stagehand and its core APIs (`act`, `extract`, `observe`).
- Quick Start guide with installation and basic usage example.
- Configuration details and options.
- Package Documentation for `StagehandClass`, `StagehandPageClass`, and `StagehandContextClass`.
- Dependencies.
- Advanced Usage Examples (referencing examples directory in the Stagehand repo, not cursor-tools).

**Consistency:**
- The documentation style is generally consistent with existing `cursor-tools` documentation (Markdown format, headers, code blocks).
- It clearly outlines the features and usage of Stagehand.

**Mistakes/Omissions:**
- It's Stagehand's documentation, not specifically tailored for `cursor-tools` integration. It lacks context on *how* Stagehand will be used *within* `cursor-tools`.
- Dependency section lists peer dependencies and dependencies, which is good, but it's important to clarify how these will be managed in `cursor-tools` (peer dependency for Playwright is already in place, Stagehand itself would be a dependency).
- Advanced Usage Examples section is a bit generic and refers to Stagehand's examples, not examples within `cursor-tools`.

**Improvements:**
- Adapt this documentation to be specifically for `cursor-tools browser stagehand` command. Focus on how to use Stagehand *through* `cursor-tools`.
- In the Advanced Usage Examples, consider adding examples that are relevant to `cursor-tools` use cases, maybe combining Stagehand with `repo` or `web` commands.
- Clarify dependency management in the context of `cursor-tools`.

**Review of `wip/stagehand-research.md` and `wip/stagehand-research-part2.md`:**

These files seem to be research notes on Stagehand, likely based on querying Perplexity AI. They cover:

- Key differences between `act`, `extract`, and `observe` APIs.
- Stagehand's handling of dynamic content (and limitations).
- Error handling best practices in Stagehand (from AWS Step Functions documentation, which might be less relevant to CLI context).
- Comparison of Stagehand vs. Playwright.
- Complex scenarios where Stagehand excels.
- Best practices for browser session management, authentication, timeouts, performance optimization, and common pitfalls in CLI browser automation.

**Consistency:**
- These are research notes, so direct consistency is less applicable. They do inform the design.

**Mistakes/Omissions:**
- The error handling section in `stagehand-research.md` seems to be about AWS Step Functions, which is likely a misinterpretation by the AI or irrelevant context. Error handling in the browser automation context within a CLI tool is different.
-  The research on session management, authentication, timeouts, and performance in `stagehand-research-part2.md` is valuable but needs to be critically evaluated and adapted to the `cursor-tools` context.

**Improvements:**
- Filter out irrelevant research findings (like AWS Step Functions error handling).
- Focus research on aspects directly applicable to CLI tools and `cursor-tools`'s architecture.
- Further research might be needed on practical session management in CLI tools, especially stateless CLI tools like `cursor-tools`.

**Review of `wip/stagehand-design.md`:**

This file is a design proposal for integrating Stagehand into `cursor-tools`. It's quite detailed and covers:

- Command Structure: `cursor-tools browser act|extract|observe`.
- Implementation using `BrowserCommand` class and new subcommand handlers (`ActCommand`, `ExtractCommand`, `ObserveCommand`).
- Key Features: AI-powered automation, Session Management (optional), Schema Validation for `extract`, Error Handling.
- Configuration: Stagehand API keys, Model selection.
- Review Aspects: Architecture, Error Handling, Performance, Security, Integration.

**1. Consistency with `cursor-tools`'s existing patterns and architecture?**

**Yes, mostly consistent:**

- **Command Structure:** The proposed `cursor-tools browser act|extract|observe` command structure is consistent with the existing `cursor-tools browser open|element` structure and the overall CLI command pattern (e.g., `cursor-tools github pr|issue`).
- **Option Handling:** The use of options like `--url`, `--model`, `--save-to`, `--help` is consistent with other `cursor-tools` commands.
- **Module Structure:** Proposing new files in `src/commands/browser/` like `act.ts`, `extract.ts`, `observe.ts`, and a utility file `stagehandUtils.ts` aligns with the modular structure used in `cursor-tools` (e.g., `src/commands/github/pr.ts`, `issue.ts`, `utils.ts`).
- **Configuration:**  The plan to integrate Stagehand API keys into `.cursor-tools.env` and `cursor-tools.config.json` is consistent with how API keys for Perplexity and Gemini are handled.

**Examples of Consistency:**
- The `BrowserCommand` class acting as a router for subcommands mirrors the `GithubCommand` and how it routes to `PrCommand` and `IssueCommand`.
- Using `CommandGenerator` and `CommandOptions` types for the new commands aligns with the existing command implementations (`WebCommand`, `RepoCommand`, etc.).

**2. What mistakes or omissions do you notice?**

- **Session Management Complexity:** The design marks session management as "optional but recommended" and acknowledges the complexity for CLI tools. However, it might be better to *start without session management* for the initial implementation to keep things simpler. Session management can be added later if there's a clear need and a good approach for a CLI context.  CLI tools are often stateless, and trying to force stateful behavior might overcomplicate things.
- **Dependency Management Detail:** While it mentions Playwright as a dependency, it should explicitly state that Stagehand itself will be added as a *dependency* in `package.json`.  Also, Zod is mentioned for schema validation, which might be a Stagehand dependency already, but needs to be considered.
- **Error Handling Granularity vs. CLI Simplicity:** While granular error handling is good, for a CLI tool, very verbose error messages might be overwhelming.  It's important to strike a balance between informative errors and CLI simplicity. Perhaps having a `--debug` or `--verbose` flag to get more detailed error outputs would be better than always being verbose.
- **Performance Optimizations - Caching:** The design mentions caching but it's unclear if Stagehand provides built-in caching and how that would be configured or controlled within `cursor-tools`. This needs more investigation.
- **Security - Code Injection Risks:**  The design touches upon code injection risks, but it's a very important point for browser automation, especially AI-driven. It should be emphasized that input to Stagehand needs to be carefully considered, and if there are any risks of executing arbitrary code or commands via Stagehand, they must be mitigated.

**Examples of Omissions/Mistakes:**
-  The "Retry Mechanisms (Optional)" section for error handling might be less relevant than robust, informative error messages in a CLI context.
-  The design doesn't explicitly address the case where Stagehand might itself depend on Playwright. It's stated Playwright is a peer dependency of `cursor-tools`, but how Stagehand's Playwright dependency is handled is not clear.

**3. What opportunities for improvement do you see?**

- **Start Simple, Iterate:**  As mentioned, start with a simpler implementation, *without* session management initially. Focus on getting the core `act`, `extract`, and `observe` commands working reliably first. Then, iterate based on user feedback and real-world usage.
- **Simplified Error Output by Default:**  Default error output should be concise and user-friendly for CLI usage. Add a `--debug` or `--verbose` option for more detailed error logs for debugging.
- **Clearer Dependency Management:**  Explicitly document Stagehand and its dependencies (including Playwright if it depends on it) in `README.md` and `docs/cursor-tools.md`. Clarify if Playwright needs to be installed separately for Stagehand to work, or if Stagehand bundles it.
- **Focus on CLI Use Cases:** Tailor the documentation and examples specifically for CLI use cases. For example, demonstrate how to use `cursor-tools browser` to debug web apps running locally, extract data for scripts, or automate simple web tasks from the command line.
- **Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of Stagehand and its integration to identify and mitigate potential security risks, especially related to code injection and API key handling.

**Examples of Improvement Opportunities:**
- Instead of `--console`/`--no-console`, consider just `--console` as a flag to enable console output, and no flag for no console output (default). Simplify boolean options where possible.
-  Provide more concrete examples of how schema validation would work in the CLI context for the `extract` command (e.g., schema file, inline schema).

**4. How well does this integrate with our existing browser command implementation?**

**Good Integration Potential:**

- The proposed Stagehand integration fits well within the existing `browser` command structure.
- Reusing the `BrowserCommand` class and adding new subcommand handlers is a clean and extensible approach.
- The option handling and overall command pattern are consistent with the existing `browser open` and `browser element` commands.

**Specific Examples of Good Integration:**
- The `BrowserCommand` class will continue to serve as the entry point for all browser-related commands, keeping the command structure organized.
- The new subcommand handlers (`ActCommand`, `ExtractCommand`, `ObserveCommand`) are designed as separate classes, mirroring the structure of `OpenCommand` and `ElementCommand`, which promotes modularity and maintainability.

**Recommendations for Integration:**

- **Keep `browser open` and `browser element` commands separate initially.** Don't try to immediately replace them with Stagehand. Let them coexist. This allows for a gradual transition and comparison. Users might still prefer the direct Playwright commands for certain tasks.
- **Ensure clear separation of concerns.** The subcommand handlers should primarily focus on interacting with Stagehand and formatting the output.  `BrowserCommand` should handle routing and general option processing. Stagehand utility functions should handle Stagehand initialization and configuration.
- **Test compatibility.** Thoroughly test the Stagehand integration alongside the existing `browser open` and `browser element` commands to ensure no regressions or conflicts are introduced.

**Overall Summary and Recommendations:**

The Stagehand integration design is promising and generally consistent with the existing `cursor-tools` codebase.

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic implementation of `act`, `extract`, and `observe` *without* session management.
2. **Prioritize Clear Error Handling:** Focus on providing user-friendly and informative error messages in the CLI context, with optional debug logging.
3. **Simplify Boolean Options:** Streamline boolean option handling for CLI usage.
4. **Document Dependencies Clearly:** Explicitly document Stagehand and its dependencies, especially Playwright.
5. **Focus on CLI Use Cases:**  Tailor documentation and examples to CLI-specific scenarios.
6. **Conduct Security Review:** Perform a thorough security assessment of Stagehand integration.
7. **Keep Existing Commands:** Maintain `browser open` and `browser element` commands alongside the Stagehand integration initially.
8. **Iterate and Test:** Implement incrementally, test thoroughly at each stage, and iterate based on user feedback.

By following these recommendations, the Stagehand integration can be implemented effectively and enhance `cursor-tools`'s browser automation capabilities in a user-friendly and robust manner.
